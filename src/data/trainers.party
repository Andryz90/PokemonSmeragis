/*
Trainers and their parties defined with Competetive Syntax.
Compatible with Pokemon Showdown exports.
https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/TEAMS.md

A trainer specification starts with "=== TRAINER_XXXX ==="
and includes everything until the next line that starts with "==="
or the file ends.
A blank line is required between the trainer and their Pokemon
and between their Pokemon.
TRAINER_XXXX is how the trainer is referred to within code.

Moves are defined with a - (dash) followed by a single space, then the move name.

Moves have to be the last lines of a Pokemon.
If no moves are specified, the Pokemon will use the last 4 moves it learns
through levelup at its level.

Default IVs and Level can be changed in the "main" function of tools/trainerproc/main.c
